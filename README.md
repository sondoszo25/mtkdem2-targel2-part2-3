to delete a contact you should press on the button of "wastebasket" near the "add contact" button , and then type the name of the contact you want to delete.
 


we are saving all the data we get from the users in Mongodb, which is running in port 27017.

*to run this code first you must make sure that mongodb is connected to the port above(27017) and after that in the terminal
of this project write npm start (the start instruction is the same as the instruction"SET NODE_ENV=local && node server.js") and in the browser go to localhost:5000*
